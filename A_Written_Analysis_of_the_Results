# Visualization of Kickstaters in Excel

## Overview of Project
Utiliziing Excel to illustrate the trends of different Kickstarter Campaigns

### Purpose
Give Louise an opportunity to examine the data as it relates to how each campaign varied based on, launch date, goal, pledges, and category. 

## Analysis and Challenges
In the process of providing Louise with a project that will help her read her data, I used a great amount of various coding functions which assisted 
me in showcasing my found informartion into charts and tables. For instance, I ustilized pitvot tables to show Louise the outcomes of the category theater
with a stacked column chart. The chart compared the successful, failed, canceled, and live outcomes of the theater parent category. I also used the =VLOOKUP()
function to display the necessary information need by Louise, of a categoriezed selection of her favorite plays. The function was used to pull the synopsis of
the play. The function was used again to pull the goal amounts and pledged amounts of each play.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When looking at the outcomes of theater based on its launch date you can inference couple facts. Between the end of April and month of May, the rate at
which the outcome was successful increases. Simultaniously, the rate at which the increase of failed theater campaigns all elavates but not as steadily. It can
also be concluded from the outcomes by launch date that during the month of october no theater categorized campaigns were canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As Louise looks at the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, she will see that when the goal of a campaign is below $4999 its probabilty of being succesful 
is greater. For example, 76 percent of campaigns with goals under $1000 were successful while only 24 percent failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I faced a challenge when computing the number of successful, failed, and cancel campaigns. When using the =COUNTIFS() function my criteria was incomplete.
I had forgotten to include whether the goal I was in search for was successful or not, and also that it's category was "play" in the function window. Omitting 
these valuable facts calculated the wrong dataset thus my numbers being incorrect when creating the table and chart for the Outcomes Based on Goals Sheet.

## Results
- In the month of January, the rate at which each parent category was successful increased while the rate at which parent category failed decreased. However, 
that changes as time will acrue. In the month of April through the first half of June, there are increasing numbers of failed campiagns. On the other hand, from
the month of May through September, the number of successful events decreases at a consistent rate. Lastly, in the month of December the rate of successful and 
failed campaigns become equivalent.

-As the goals increase the relationship between the successful and failed campaigns is negative. As one increases the other decreases and visa versa. There are
three points of equilibrium as it relates the percentage of successful and failed campaigns: goals $15000 to $19000, between goals $30000 to $35000, and between
goals $40000 to $45000.

-Unfortunately, the outcome of any future campaigns can not be correctly predicted by campaigns of the past. Each statistic calculated will vary based on the 
audience attending, the location of the event, and much more.

-We could also create a table on how the total of which was donated to a spicific campaign correlates to its successful or failed outcome.
