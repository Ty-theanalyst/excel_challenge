It is evident that theatrical productions were more succesful when compare to others. For instance, 839 theater campaigns were successful where as only 540 muscial campaigns were successful. I would suggest to Louise to gear-towards campaigning more theater styled events in the act of plays. I suggest this because theater plays are statistically more likely to reach their goal and be more profitable. On the basis of my analysis, I also would recommend that Louise launched the campains more in the months of April and May. During the end of April and begining of May, the success rate of the theater campaigns are beginning to reach their peak of having an outcome of successful.
